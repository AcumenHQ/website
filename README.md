Acumen: A Prediction & Edu/Alpha Platform on Solana
Acumen is a project on the Solana blockchain with a native token, $ACUM, that has two main uses.
1. Prediction Marketplace
This platform will allow users to predict the performance of new Solana meme tokens. You can predict things like:
 * How quickly a token will gain traction.
 * If a token will reach a certain market cap and how long it will take.
$ACUM holders get special perks. Early holders will receive a 2x airdrop of their initial holdings into their prediction accounts. A leaderboard will track the top 300 holders eligible for this reward. Even if you don't make the top 300, you will still receive free $ACUM tokens to get started.
2. Edu/Alpha Sessions
By holding a specific amount of $ACUM, you gain access to exclusive educational resources and insights. This includes:
 * Free Web3 onboarding courses.
 * Early alpha insights and crypto trends.
 * Information on potential projects, ambassadorships, and job opportunities (e.g., Discord moderator roles).
This feature will be live from day one and is designed to help newcomers transition from Web2 to Web3.
Tokenomics and Roadmap
A portion of the creator fees from $ACUM trading will be used for token buybacks, which will then be airdropped to early supporters. A portion of the token supply is also set aside for marketing, airdrops for active users, and continued product development.
